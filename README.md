One-step to switch aar dependency or source dependency.

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](https://github.com/qiugang/DepSwitchPlugin/blob/master/README-zh.md)

For a slightly larger Android projects, packaging business modules into aar dependencies is a common operation, uploading to public or self-built maven, and the main project will rely on these aars. But for the actual development process, developers often need to switch dependencies from aar to source dependencies to complete new features or debug.

DepSwicth can use its own configuration file to switch to local source dependencies in one step, without modifying the specific build.gradle to improve development efficiency. It is also highly recommended to add the configuration file to ```.gitignore``` to resolve conflicts caused by modifying the build.gradle file in multiplayer development mode.

### How it works

DepSwitch will handle the same config alias in the dependency of build.gradle and ```dep-switch.json``` config file.
By default, the dependencies of the DepSwitch configuration in build.gradle are used. The dependency switch is defined by ```status``` field in ```dep-switch.json``` .

For example:

in example project, we add normal dependencyï¼Œalias is ```module_a```
```
depSwitch {
    "module_a" {
        action = "implementation"
        dependency = "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.1.0"
    }
}
```
and the DepSwitchPlugin config file(```dep-switch.json```) is

```
[
    {
        "name": "module_a",
        "depNotation": "example_module",
        "status": true
    },
    {
        "name": "module_b",
        "depNotation": "${your local src module}",
        "status": false
    }
]

```

the result of alias named ```module_a``` will be configured as ```implementation project(":example_module")```
to complete dependency switch.

### How to use

with gradle
```
apply plugin: 'dep-switch'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.github.qiugang:DepSwitchPlugin:${lastest-verion}"
    }
}

depSwitch {
    "module_a" {
        action = "implementation"
        dependency = "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.1.0"
    }
    "module_b" {
        action = "implementation"
        dependency = "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.4.0"
    }
    //...
}
```
add ```dep-switch.json``` to sub project directory

```
[
    {
        "name": "module_a",
        "depNotation": "example_module",
        "status": true
    },
    {
        "name": "module_b",
        "depNotation": "${your local src module}",
        "status": false
    }
]
```
